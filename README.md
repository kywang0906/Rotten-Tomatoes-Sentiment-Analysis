# Rotten-Tomatoes-Sentiment-Analysis
(This project is based on the sentiment analysis assignment of CS221 at Stanford University.)

## Project Overview ##
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes' Review dataset as either positive or negative based solely on the text. The model is implemented using a logistic regression algorithm, but instead of relying on machine learning libraries, the model is built from scratch. The logistic regression is trained using the hinge loss function and optimized with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics.
